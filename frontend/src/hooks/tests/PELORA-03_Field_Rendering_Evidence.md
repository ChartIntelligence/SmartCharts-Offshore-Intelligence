# PELORA-03 controlled field rendering evidence

Date: 2026-10-06. Workspace: C:\Projects\Pelora-Agent-Worktrees\pelora-03-living-ocean.
Branch: codex/pelora-03-living-ocean.
Baseline/governance HEAD: 94cc8b41fbf1e440dc2a27618617704a93025782.
Source baseline: dadec5dbca7d360f70f633413fb6a347dc24cac1.
Candidate identity: the commit containing this evidence; exact executable SHA-256 fingerprints below.
PELORA-00 explicitly extended ownership to viewportFieldRequests.js and its dedicated tests for context-checked per-layer invalidation only.

## Environment and controlled scope

Node v24.18.0. The required @maplibre/maplibre-gl-style-spec resolves from this workspace's tracked root node_modules; its version is 24.10.0, matching frontend/package-lock.json, and validateStyleMin loads successfully. frontend/node_modules is absent; React 19.2.7 is not installed. The existing hook harness supplies a VM useEffect seam, controlled fetch/map/canvas/timers and requires no React installation. No packages installed or copied. No real provider/Auth/database/production requests, credentials, build, full-app runtime or physical device tests.

Read original field delivery, scalar runtime, captain state, product vision and backend/fields/fieldService.js legacy shape contracts. Scalar delivery remains a separate contract and is not activated here.

## Baseline reproduction, before edits

All three existing focused scripts listed below passed at baseline. A controlled in-memory variant of useMapLibreOceanFields.test.js replaced the fixture transport after its first valid render; no baseline files were edited.

Fixture identity: current fieldId recorded, validTime 2026-09-19T00:00:00Z, vector [-89.875,27.125,-0.291,0.948], same viewport [-90,27,-89,28], densities 12/48. Replacement fieldId rejected-cells-null preserved the other fixture properties but used payload:{cells:null}. Bathymetry fixture remained unchanged.

Observed assertions passed:
- After moveend loading, capture the currents source data object; after awaiting replacement, state.currents.status is unavailable, but that exact source data object remains attached and its JSON still identifies recorded. Both layer visibilities are visible.
- style.load reapplies that same retained render buffer while the malformed response remains rejected.
- A later same-context controlled transport exception republishes the helper's cached malformed response: the hook's reason is a flatMap conversion error instead of transport degradation.

The first probe captured the source object before loading and failed its reference-equality assertion because loading legitimately reconverts retained valid data. The corrected probe captured it after loading; all three reproduction observations then passed. This probe failure is not a candidate test failure.

## Repair and acceptance

Presentation checks the existing legacy axes, cell dimensions/types, row/component order, bounds, resolution, coverage counts and metadata consumed for field status before conversion. Null remains missing, finite zero remains zero; a valid zero vector produces no arrow and keeps its source/status identity. No scientific value coercion, threshold, derivation, source admission or policy is added.

The helper invalidate(layer,contextKey) silently deletes only that layer's matching cached context, without field mutation or sibling invalidation. Hook failures clear the affected retained display buffer, hide/clear the map layer/source (with removal fallback), invalidate its cached context, and publish unavailable with field:null. Deferred application is loading until successful map application. Idle/style callbacks use the current cleared buffers and cannot restore rejected data. Each layer's map application has its own failure boundary.

Focused commands, all PASS in final replay:
- node frontend/src/hooks/tests/useMapLibreOceanFields.test.js
- node frontend/src/utils/tests/oceanFields.test.js
- node frontend/src/utils/tests/viewportFieldRequests.test.js
- node --check for each of the six JS paths below
- git diff --check

The scripts use assertions and completion messages, not node:test case counts; no invented case total is reported.

Hook acceptance covers valid render then malformed cells/axes/values/metadata, canvas conversion exception, source setData/updateImage/addSource failures, layout failure, true style source/layer recreation, pending idle failure, later style/transport failure, cross-layer locality in both directions, zero vector identity, changed-context clearing and captured callbacks after disposal. Utilities additionally exercise actual canvas context, fillRect and toDataURL failure seams, ascending/finite axes and zero/null bathymetry. Helper tests cover silent/nonmutating exact-context invalidation, wrong context, repeated/no-entry invalidation, sibling retention, later transport without rejected data, valid degraded/provider-unavailable retention, density/context identity, debounce/cancel, late responses and disposal.

## Limits and exclusions

Controlled fixtures do not qualify environmental sources, physical-device/mobile performance, GPU behavior or the reported real black-screen incident. Map operations that all fail during teardown cannot guarantee physical removal; the retained application buffers/cache are still cleared and unavailable is reported. Real browser/React rendering and full frontend build remain unverified. No Dashboard.jsx, LayerControls.jsx, MapLegend.jsx, shell CSS, backend, acquisition, SST/chlorophyll, derivatives, ranking, science/admission or publication changes. No source/history admission, CP-10, beta-ready claim, Receipt Writer enablement, quarantined-science reopening, integration, deployment or production qualification.
